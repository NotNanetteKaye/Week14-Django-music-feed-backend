In this section of the course you will be bringing together all of the concepts and technologies you have learnt to build your first full stack application! Full stack applications are complete applications that can accomplish nearly any software goal. By combining a database, backend API, and frontend application, we can create complete applications that can scale and handle the needs of a user.

This week we will be focusing on the database and backend portion of the project. This means creating the Django JSON Web API project, endpoints, and database data/connection.  

The lectures in this section will introduce you to the concept of asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming allows our code to accomplish multiple tasks (functions) at a time providing greater speed and an enhanced user experience. You will learn how asynchronous programing works and how to handle it in your application's code.

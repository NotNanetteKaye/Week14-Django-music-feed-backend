In this section of the course you will be bringing together all of the concepts and technologies you have learnt to build your first full stack application! Full stack applications are complete applications that can accomplish nearly any software goal. By combining a database, backend API, and frontend application, we can create complete applications that can scale and handle the needs of a user.

This week we will be focusing on the database and backend portion of the project. This means creating the Django JSON Web API project, endpoints, and database data/connection.
